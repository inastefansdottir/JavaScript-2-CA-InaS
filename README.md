A playful, social media app for pets ‚Äî built with **Node.js, Express, EJS, Vanilla JavaScript, and CSS** for my Noroff JavaScript 2 course assignment.  
The app allows users to register, log in, create posts, edit their profile, follow other users, and interact with posts through likes, comments, and shares.

## Project Overview  
Petify is a social media platform designed around pets and their owners.  

- **Public users:** Can register for an account for free and log in.
- **Registered users:** Can create posts, like, comment, share, follow/unfollow, and manage their profiles.  

I adapted Noroff‚Äôs ‚Äúsocial media app with CRUD‚Äù assignment into a themed community site, focusing on both functionality and **UI/UX design** to feel like a polished real-world product.
